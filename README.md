# How to Setup and Use a VPN | ProtonVPN
 
## Description

In this project, I created an Azure VM (Virtual Machine) and downloaded, installed, and used a free VPN (Virtual Private Network) called ProtonVPN.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) allow you to connect to a network through encrypted tunnels, enhancing security. Two common ways VPNs are used are, allowing remote work or companies, and accessing different content that otherwise would be unavailable without a VPN.

## Environments and Utilities Used

* ProtonVPN
* Microsoft Azure

## Project Walk-through:

First Create An Azure VM

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0481963e-eaf3-4be8-afc7-bf14f5dfb132)

Then Locate your IP With 

https://whatismyipaddress.com/

Make sure to copy your IPV4 address and the other information for your location into a Notepad or somewhere on your computer
where you can easily access it

NEXT, USE A REMOTE DESKTOP CONNECTION TO CONNECT YOUR VM

After signing in with your username and Password into your Vm in the Remote Desktop:

Now look up your IP in your virtual machine on the Remote desktop:

Now, I can head over to ProtonVPN and sign up for a free account:

On your actual computer, sign up for the free version of Proton VPN 

https://account.protonvpn.com/signup?plan=free&language=en  

THE SIGN UP FOR FREE

WILL ASK YOU TO DOWNLOAD:

Do not download on your actual computer but rather in the VM

Back within your VM, download the Proton VPN client
Login to the VPN (https://account.protonvpn.com/login) and choose a VPN server in yet another country (such as Japan)
Browse to https://whatismyipaddress.com/  and take note of this in a text file

Ones you in Download:

Then select Quick Connect

Browse to https://whatismyipaddress.com/  and take note of this in a text file

As we can see, our VPN is pointing to a different country

Also, while connected to the VPN I can go to different sites like www.google.com and www.netflix.com to see the difference compared to if I were on these sites within my own physical computer browser:

As you can see, the one on the VM shows a different language which is Romanian as compared to what is on my actual PC which is in English

## The Setup and Use of Proton is now Complete!

We've successfully downloaded, installed, and used a free VPN called ProtonVPN! We observed all of the different changes that happened with our IP address and location, and saw some possibilities like accessing different content while using a VPN!
