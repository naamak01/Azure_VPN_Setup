# How to Setup and Use a VPN | ProtonVPN
 
## Description

In this project, I created an Azure VM (Virtual Machine) and downloaded, installed, and used a free VPN (Virtual Private Network) called ProtonVPN.

VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) allow you to connect to a network through encrypted tunnels, enhancing security. Two common ways VPNs are used are, allowing remote work or companies, and accessing different content that otherwise would be unavailable without a VPN.

## Environments and Utilities Used
